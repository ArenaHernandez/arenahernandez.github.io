      <em>DevOps and IVR Test Engineer</em>
      <p>In a dual role as both a DevOps Engineer and IVR Tester, I deployed and tested T-Mobile microservices for the
        consumer T-Mobile App and IVR functionalities. This involved troubleshooting and testing containerized
        applications as necessary, devising, and executing load test plans, and developing scripts tailored for
        post-deployment end-to-end testing. Spearheading the creation of monitoring and telemetry dashboards for
        efficient ops management, I utilized insights from IVR call data analysis to uncover valuable information,
        including average call duration, completion rates, and waiting times. These efforts directly contributed to
        measurable improvements in system performance and user experience.</p>
